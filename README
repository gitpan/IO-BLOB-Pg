IO::PgLoFile is an IO::File (and IO::Handle) compatible class that
reads or writes data to Postgresql's large objects (aka BLOBs).  I
built this on top of Gisle Aas' IO::String, so he did most of the work
here.  I just tweaked it to do the Blobs.

This module requires perl5.005_03 or better because it works best with
Chip's no-memory-leak-on-self-tie-patch.

Installation as usual:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Documentation is embedded in the module.
