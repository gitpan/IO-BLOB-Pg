	* lib/IO/BLOB/Pg.pm:
	  new(): Fixed to return undef on failure of new();
	  pad(): Implemented
	  truncate(): extends the size of the blob, but doesn't truncate it.
	  seek():act like builtin seek (returns 1 on success)
	  
	* t/*: ported over other tests from IO::String to verify
	functionality -- found a few bugs (seek) in the meantime.
